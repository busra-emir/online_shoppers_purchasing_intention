# Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention

## Problem Statement
Technological developments have facilitated the rapid spread of online shopping and its adoption by consumers.
Businesses have had to alter their sales methods to online platforms in order to engage with clients and keep this engagement going. Even while most internet customers just look at things, a relatively small percentage actually make a purchase. As a result, businesses now need to identify potential customers and forecast which consumers are most likely to buy.
